                        Life happens.  And, it did.  An emotional roller coast at that.<br/>
                        My mom was diagnosed with cancer. I felt like I was being hit by a train. The thought of losing her - the center of my universe - was just shattering.  I could not bring myself to imagine it. Needless to say, I was utterly devastated.<br/>
                        The tribulations of seeing her in pain and going through numerous rounds of chemo treatments took a toll on all of us and, in the process, changed me.  I no longer believe that I am invincible.<br/>
                        Then, I lost something - something important.  I was not prepared to deal with the aftermath.  So I sunk into a rut.  I did not know what to do with myself.  In not so many words, I was simply lost. <br/>
                        In the midst of self-reflection, I turn to photography.  Perhaps to find myself.  Perhaps to live vicariously through my lens. Deep down, I think I am just ecstatic doing it.  They say to make memories.  And I am when I take photos.  The thing I love about photos is that the captured moments last - unlike the ephemeral things in life that you hope can stay everlasting. <br/>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <img class="home-image-2" src="images/leaf.jpg" alt="Leaf in the park" />
                        And so I trudge on.  Bringing my camera with me wherever I go.  Whenever I can.  Just so I can take photos.  Before long, I start to see things.  I notice things.  I allow myself to take everything in.  Seeing the extraordinary from the ordinary.  Live in the moment as it has taught me.  There are numerous things that just deserve savoring.  Truly.  Be it countries I have visited.  Different people I have met.  Cultures that I have encountered.  Everything that surrounds me.  There is an unspoken magic in them.  As magical as the wonderland that lives in people's dreams - the territory that awaits explorations.<br/>It takes a pro to derive meanings from life.  Admittedly, I am still an amateur with regards to that.  I learn as I go.  It is a journey that started long ago.  I find that I am never at the destination.  At the end, the answers that I search for may stay elusive. But at least, I can say that I have experienced as much as I possibly could.<br/>
                        My photography captures what I see.  I hope that, by perusing through them, you will also come to feel what I feel.  This is a world I created not just for myself. I want to share it with you.
